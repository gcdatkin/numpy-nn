# numpy-nn
A neural network coded from scratch using only NumPy. Currently supports binary classification using fully connected layers.  
  
The code also includes an example of the model's performance on a sample dataset. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and can be found here:

The code was written in Google Colab and directly exported into the .py file, so the file works best in a REPL.
